🎮 I am a self-taught programmer. 😅 Hail ChatGPT, YouTube, Github, Stack Overflow! 🌺 YKWIM =) 

👩🏻‍🔬 I enjoy experimenting, thinking, learning, and creating! wanna do something funny (but maybe not useful)

My graduate studies focused mainly on multi-objective optimization algorithms and their application in water resource management problems. (Yes I currently study Environmental Science 🌎)

My PhD grogam is focused on wildfire and associated changes in streamflow (Please Please Please Let Me Get What I Want), long-term time series prediction thing 🔥🥵

### 🍀 Fun facts about me (精神状态一览：Yes, and?)


🗣️ Multilingual (English/Mandarin/Cantonese) and learning French on Duolinguo (Comment ça va! but lost streak in 2024, anyway, fuck you 2024) 😅

💵 Minimalist (in other words, poor ;), trying to reduce coffee and sugar intake ... (I don't think it's possible to reduce coffee intake for a PhD student)

🎸 Please start playing your Fender Mustang 🐎 in 2025 or I will send it to ebay 🙄

😇 <s>Hoping to join in the 27 club if I still have no publications in 2025 (but still aggressively wanna do this PhD program, December 2024 really changed my whole life) </s>

#### Looking ahead, my life aspiration is: live fast, die young, be wild, and have fun 😇

#### 鸭头，我住在农场只是为了体验自给自足的生活，弹弹吉他，回顾老日子，你不要再嫌弃我是个乡下豚，搬过来跟我一起住，好吗？好的。不说了我鱼竿动了我先走了 🤠
