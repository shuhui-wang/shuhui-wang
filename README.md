🎮 I am a beginner in programming with three years of experience (actually a self-taught programmer. 😅 Hail YouTube, Github, Stack Overflow! 🌺 YKWIM =) 

👩🏻‍🔬 I enjoy experimenting, thinking, learning, and creating! 

My graduate studies focused mainly on multi-objective optimization algorithms and their application in water resource management problems. (Yes I currently study Environmental Science 🌎)

**Looking ahead, my aspiration is: live fast, die young, be wild, and have fun 😇
